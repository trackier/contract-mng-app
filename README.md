## **Contract Management**

This is primarily to keep records of all the contracts signed in the company with records of signing users and files uploaded with the records. This makes it easier for users to manage contract details in one place.

## Asset Management

The Asset Management  name itself defines the use case and the working of this project, let go for a deeper explanation. In this project company assets are managed by creating a crud operation of different models.

So it becomes easy to manage assets and keep a record of the assets.
